// The core module of the mhfe browser package: encryption, recovery, the rehearsal check, rekey,
// hidden wallets and the self-test, with Argon2. Every operation runs in a new Web Worker, so a
// long Argon2 computation never blocks the page, cancel() can end it at once, and the worker's
// memory is freed when the worker is terminated, as soon as it has loaded the WebAssembly.
//
// The page supplies the parts of the module as text and bytes, because a page under a strict
// Content-Security-Policy may not fetch anything:
//
//   const client = new MhfeClient({
//     workerSource,          // text of runtime/worker.js
//     wasm,                  // runtime/mhfe.wasm as a Uint8Array or a WebAssembly.Module
//     argon2Threaded,        // text of core/argon2-mt.js
//     argon2SingleThreaded,  // text of core/argon2-st.js
//   });
//
// A page that uses other module classes too compiles runtime/mhfe.wasm once, with
// WebAssembly.compile, and passes the WebAssembly.Module to each.
//
// Every operation returns a promise and reports every error by rejecting it, the checks of its
// arguments included; none throws when it is called. A callback of the page that throws, or whose
// promise rejects, stops the operation and rejects it with CALLBACK_FAILED. mode(),
// maxSupportedMemLevel() and cancel() are synchronous. Only the constructor throws, for missing
// package parts. One long operation runs at a time (BUSY otherwise); reading words and the
// parameters never wait. The first operation waits for the class's startup check
// (startupCheck()); parameters(), selfTest(), startupCheck() and fullCheck() do not.

   * confirms the one reading found. Several lengths that pass by accident reject
   * `{ builtInCheck: true }` and the owner with AMBIGUOUS_LENGTH, unless the owner's stated length
   * is one of them: rekey again confirmed by an address or the fingerprint, which compares every
   * reading, or by the owner with the length of the reading to compare stated. A stated length
   * whose built-in check fails while one other length's passes rejects `{ builtInCheck: true }`
   * with LENGTH_DIFFERS, as the check takes precedence: rekey again confirmed by an address, the
   * fingerprint or the owner, whose callback then gets the reading the check found. The owner
   * beside 24 stated words is rejected with LENGTH_DIFFERS too when one 12- to 21-word length
   * passes its check: only an address or the fingerprint tells the two readings apart. A stated
   * 12- to 21-word length whose check fails while no other passes rejects with VERIFIER_MISMATCH,
   * whatever the confirmation.
   *
   * After AMBIGUOUS_LENGTH or LENGTH_DIFFERS, which come once the recovery's rounds are done,
   * `onConfirmAgain` is called, when given, with `{ error, ownerLengths }`: the refusal as an
   * MhfeError, and the lengths at which the owner may compare the phrase with their backup, empty
   * where only an address or the fingerprint confirms it. It returns another confirmation, which
   * is judged on the same recovery without the rounds again: `{ address, coin, path?,
   * passphrase? }`, `{ fingerprint, passphrase? }`, or `{ owner, words }` with `words` one of
   * `ownerLengths` (left out when there is only one); or null, which rejects with the refusal.
   * After AMBIGUOUS_LENGTH the owner states the length of the reading to compare; after
   * LENGTH_DIFFERS it is the stated one, and the owner callback gets the reading the check found.
   * The answer to `walletHasPassphrase` holds for every confirmation. Without `onConfirmAgain`,
   * and after every other refusal, the rekey ends: a page calls rekey() again, which recovers
   * again.
   *
   * `confirmation` is exactly one of `{ builtInCheck: true }`, `{ address, coin, path? }`,
   * `{ fingerprint }` or `{ owner: (check) => boolean | Promise<boolean> }`
   * (readContainer().confirmationFor says which a length needs, "0" for detection). The wallet
   * check, 16 bits, never confirms a phrase to encrypt again. The owner callback receives
   * `{ phrase, words, statedWords?, fingerprintWithoutPassphrase }` to compare with the written
   * backup, `statedWords` only where the built-in check found another length than the one stated,
   * which the page says first; anything but true stops the rekey with NOT_CONFIRMED_BY_OWNER.
   * Resolves as encrypt does, with `walletCheck`, the 16-bit source check of a recovered 24-word
   * reading with the reference's passphrase or none (null for other lengths), which every recovery
   * reports and which never confirms a rekey.
   *
   * `walletHasPassphrase` is the user's answer whether the wallet has a BIP39 passphrase, which
   * the new container's keep list names. An address or a fingerprint compared with a non-empty
   * `passphrase` shows that it has one: there the answer may be left out, and false is refused.
   * Everywhere else it is required (INVALID_REQUEST without it): the built-in check and the owner
   * show nothing, and a reference without a passphrase matches the phrase's wallet without one,
   * which says nothing about funds under a passphrase, so it confirms only a wallet stated to have
   * none: true is refused, as such a wallet is compared with its passphrase. These refusals come
   * before the first round; only the 1 MiB known answer of the Argon2 build runs first.
   * `passphrase` belongs only to an address or a fingerprint: a non-empty one with the built-in
   * check or the owner is a TypeError.
