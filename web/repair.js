// The repair module of the mhfe browser package: the repair words of a container and the repair of
// a damaged container phrase (MHFE-REPAIR-1). No Argon2 and no secret. A page supplies the module's
// files as text and bytes:
//
//   const repair = new MhfeRepair({
//     workerSource,   // text of runtime/worker.js
//     wasm,           // runtime/mhfe.wasm as a Uint8Array or a WebAssembly.Module
//   });
//
// A page that uses several module classes compiles runtime/mhfe.wasm once, with
// WebAssembly.compile, and passes the WebAssembly.Module to each.
//
// Every method returns a promise and reports every error by rejecting it; none throws when it is
// called. Each call runs in a worker of its own, so calls never wait for each other. The first call
// waits for the class's startup check (startupCheck()).
