// The wallet module of the mhfe browser package: the wallet check of a recovered phrase
// (MHFE-WALLET-CHECK-SEED-1), master key fingerprints, what an address check searches, and new
// 24-word phrases. No Argon2. A page supplies the module's files as text and bytes:
//
//   const wallet = new MhfeWallet({
//     workerSource,   // text of runtime/worker.js
//     wasm,           // runtime/mhfe.wasm as a Uint8Array or a WebAssembly.Module
//   });
//
// A page that uses several module classes compiles runtime/mhfe.wasm once, with
// WebAssembly.compile, and passes the WebAssembly.Module to each.
//
// Every method returns a promise and reports every error by rejecting it; none throws when it is
// called. Each call runs in a worker of its own, terminated afterwards. A new phrase is a
// JavaScript string, which cannot be wiped: a page shows it only on request and drops it soon
// after. The first call waits for the class's startup check (startupCheck()).
