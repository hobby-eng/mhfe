// passwords/passwords.js, wallet/wallet.js) imports it from "../runtime/runtime.js" and uses it by
// composition.

// ends an operation at once, and the worker's memory, secrets included, is freed when the worker
// is terminated, which waits until a worker still loading the WebAssembly has loaded it. Every module
// runs in the same WebAssembly, runtime/mhfe.wasm; a request names its module and operation.
