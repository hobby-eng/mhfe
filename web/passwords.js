// The passwords module of the mhfe browser package: the review of a typed password under its check
// word (MHFE-PASSWORD-CHECK-1), the strength estimate and the password generator. No Argon2. A page
// supplies the module's files as text and bytes:
//
//   const passwords = new MhfePasswords({
//     workerSource,   // text of runtime/worker.js
//     wasm,           // runtime/mhfe.wasm as a Uint8Array or a WebAssembly.Module
//   });
//
// A page that uses several module classes compiles runtime/mhfe.wasm once, with
// WebAssembly.compile, and passes the WebAssembly.Module to each.
//
// Every method returns a promise and reports every error by rejecting it; none throws when it is
// called. Each call runs in a worker of its own, which is terminated afterwards with every copy of
// the password in it. Results that hold a password or its words are JavaScript strings, which
// cannot be wiped: a page shows them only on request and drops them soon after. The first call
// waits for the class's startup check (startupCheck()).
