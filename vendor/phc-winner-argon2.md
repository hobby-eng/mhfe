# Vendored Argon2 reference implementation

`vendor/phc-winner-argon2/` holds the reference C implementation of Argon2 by Daniel Dinu, Dmitry
Khovratovich, Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Samuel Neves. MHFE uses it as its only Argon2 engine: the
native command-line tool compiles it through `build.rs`, and the browser package compiles it with
Emscripten through `scripts/build-argon2-wasm.sh`.

| Branch state          | the commit was the head of `master` when it was vendored on 2026-09-29   |
| Last upstream release | tag `20190702`, commit `62358ba2123abd17fccf2a108a301d4b52c01a7c`        |
| Vendored              | `include/`, `src/`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`                               |

The files were exported with `git archive` from a clone at that commit, and each file was checked
against the commit with `git hash-object`. They are unmodified. MHFE needs no patch; if one is ever
needed, it goes into a separate, documented patch file next to this document instead of an edit of
the vendored files.

Between the release `20190702` and the vendored commit, the vendored files changed only in comment
URLs (`http` to `https`), in preprocessor guards for Windows and MinGW, and in a spelling fix. The
algorithm did not change.

## Files that are compiled

- Both builds: `src/argon2.c`, `src/core.c`, `src/encoding.c`, `src/thread.c`,
  `src/blake2/blake2b.c`.
- Native `x86_64`: `src/opt.c`. Other native architectures, including ARM64, and the browser:
  `src/ref.c`.
- Not compiled: `src/bench.c`, `src/genkat.c`, `src/genkat.h`, `src/run.c` and `src/test.c`, which
  are upstream's own benchmark, test and command-line programs.

## Licence

The authors release the code under CC0 1.0 or the Apache License 2.0, at the user's option; both
texts are in `phc-winner-argon2/LICENSE`. MHFE uses the code under the **Apache License 2.0**:
releases ship that licence text with the code, and any change to a vendored file would be kept as a
separate patch file that says what was changed and why.

## Review of upstream issues and pull requests

On 2026-09-29 all 112 issues and pull requests opened upstream since the `20190702` release (the
newest from 2026-08-02) were read. Most are questions, bindings, build-system changes and README
links. The points that matter for MHFE:

- **Maintenance.** The upstream organiser confirmed in #378 (2024) that the repository is no longer
  maintained because the algorithm and API are frozen. MHFE therefore pins one commit and keeps any
  future change as its own documented patch.
- **Correctness.** No report shows a wrong hash from the library code. The only such report, #329
  (ARM64), was a newline added by `echo` to the password.
- **Error and wiping paths.** #298 concerns the encoded-string output, which MHFE does not use; on
  an Argon2 error, `argon2_hash` wipes its output buffer without copying it. #297 and #299 concern
  the upstream command-line program `run.c`, which MHFE does not compile. #283 reports `free(NULL)`,
  which is valid C.
- **Validation order.** #300 and #301 change the order of parameter checks. MHFE validates its own
  parameters before calling Argon2 and always uses four lanes.
- **Threads.** #331 proposes returning from the thread function instead of calling `pthread_exit`,
  to avoid a `libgcc_s` dependency on minimal systems. Both work; MHFE keeps upstream's code.
- **CPU instructions.** #308 is a crash with an invalid instruction after `opt.c` was compiled for a
  newer processor than the one running it; the failing virtual machine offered SSE2 and SSE3 but not
  SSSE3. This decides which instruction set the native `x86_64` build may assume.

## Limits worth knowing

- On 32-bit targets, including WebAssembly, `ARGON2_MAX_MEMORY_BITS` in `include/argon2.h` limits
  memory to `2^21` KiB, exactly 2 GiB. The browser build therefore supports memory level 0 only; a
  larger level fails with `ARGON2_MEMORY_TOO_MUCH` before any memory is allocated. On 64-bit targets
  the limit is `2^32 - 1` KiB, which covers every MHFE memory level.
- `secure_wipe_memory` uses `explicit_bzero` with glibc and `SecureZeroMemory` on Windows. Where
  neither exists and `memset_s` is not a macro, as with Emscripten, it calls `memset` through a
  volatile function pointer so that the compiler cannot drop the wipe.
